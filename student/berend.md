## Project Eden

You can feel a lot of solitude and loneliness living at home by yourself. Many people experience this, from young people moving out of their parents house to elderly living in retirement housing. The silence at home can be distressing and the lack of social contact is
bad for mental health.

Project Eden is a virtual companion created to be your friend at home. Build on top of the Google Assistant ecosystem Eden can sense your emotions by wearables, respond
accordingly and get you connected to others. For example she can have you play online games like chess or rummikub against other elderly alone at home. And all of this by only using your voice. This way you meet new people while Eden guides you along the way
