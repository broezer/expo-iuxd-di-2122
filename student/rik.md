## Petite

A Petite box contains ingredients, stories, music, games and toys based on a specific culture or season. The recipes are fun and simple which makes them accessible for kids. Petite brings food closer to children. They will have physical contact with food while contributing to the family. In this way, kids will become overall more confident and adventurous eaters. 

Because brands like McDonald’s and M&M are doing a really great job at selling junk to children, Petite uses the same psychology. Only in this case, to highlight the divine products that mother earth has to offer. I believe Petite is a gateway to family quality time, joy, health and education.
