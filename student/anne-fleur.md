## Gaia: Interactive 3D installation 

What is my new concept?  

Gaia is in the Greek mythology the personification of mother earth. Gaia is the ancestral mother of all life.  

Gaia is an interactive 3D experience where you learn how to connect to other animals again. The experience has as goal show the value of connection to other living beings. 

### Room 1: Information 

In the first room you get information about the behavior that is on the screen demonstrated. 

### Room 2: Similarities 

In the second room you get information about the similarities between species. To show the humans that we are actually not that different from other animals because we show a lot of the same behaviors as other animals do. 

### Room 3: Connect  

In this room you experiment with the information you just learned. For example, if you learned in the previous room about how you can communicate through your body language you can experiment in this room with this and see how the animal would react in real life.  

By teaching people about behavior, the similarities between species in behavior and let them experiment with the knowledge they gained in an interactive way they will connect to other living beings again and will make different choices towards them. Because if they know the value of other living beings, they will make different choices towards them. Because something your connected with you will care for differently and value more.  

Gaia is for people that are interest in animal behavior in all age groups. This will be an independent exposition, still will be a pop-up/gorilla.  

For every different culture/religion there will be a different animal at the center of the exposition. In some cultures/religions some animals aren’t as socially accepted as the other. But the basics of communicating to animals remain the same. 

The goal of Gaia is the reconnect to other animals again and show the value of them in human lives.
