## Head inside 

Look inside the head of someone who struggles with depression.  

My innovation is about better understanding a depression. People who are suffering from a depression know how this feels. But in this world, it is hard to just live your life when you are suffering from this. It would be nice if friends or family who are not dealing with a depression will understand them, but that is a lot of the time not the case. If you don’t suffer from a depression it is hard to understand the feelings of someone who suffers from a depression.  

This problem is both for the person who suffers from a depression, and for the friend who doesn’t understand this struggle. Because it would be nice to talk about it with someone, but a friend wants to understand and help someone’s who struggles with it. 

Head inside is an exposition in a museum. It is made for the people who don’t suffer from a depression but want to understand how it feels to have a depression. This to understand a depression better.  

It will be an experience journey of someone who suffers from a depression. Someone tells their story and by telling their experience they will talk about their feelings. These feelings will be felt in the exposition though different features. The person will tell their journey. In this journey will be ups and downs of course and with this story there will be fitting thoughts and feelings that will be shown and felt in the room. 

By doing this I want to make depressions discussable. People struggle to talk about it and people who don’t know the feeling struggle with understanding. Via this exposition I want to help both parties and make them feel more comfortable.  
 
Let’s help the people who suffer from a depression by trying to understand their feelings better through Head Inside!
